# 🎬 Demo Scenario — Humanitarian Project Manager (Extreme Workday Risk Case)

## Persona Overview

**Name:** Ahmed Al-Hakimi  
**Age:** 38  
**Role:** Senior Humanitarian Project Manager (Health & Nutrition Program)  
**Location:** Rural district field base (limited electricity, unstable internet)  
**Workload:** 10–14 hours/day, frequent emergency calls, heavy reporting, and constant coordination with HQ and field teams.

Ahmed manages a large humanitarian project serving multiple villages. He is responsible for:
- staff supervision and performance
- supply chain coordination
- donor reporting and compliance
- field supervision visits
- rapid response during outbreaks and emergencies

Ahmed is highly committed and known for being “always available,” but his work routine has silently pushed him into an extreme health risk state.

## Why Ahmed Started Using the Platform

Ahmed began feeling:
- constant fatigue
- headaches at the end of the day
- neck and shoulder pain
- reduced concentration
- irritability
- poor sleep

He did not consider this a medical issue—he assumed it was “normal work stress.”

He started using the **Workday Resilience AI** because he wanted a private, offline tool that could help him understand what was happening without sharing personal health data online.

### Platform Output (Workspace Tab)
**Workspace Risk Score: HIGH**

The platform highlights:
- poor posture and laptop-only work posture
- continuous work without breaks
- high ergonomic strain environment

**Recommendation:**
- raise monitor to eye level
- add lumbar support (rolled towel if no chair support)
- introduce a 3-minute break every 45–60 minutes

## Day 2 — Hydration & Stimulant Pattern (Hidden Dehydration)

Ahmed records:

- **Water intake:** 2 cups  
- **Caffeine intake:** 5 cups  
- **Sugary drinks:** 3  
- **Urine color:** Dark Yellow  
- **Thirst level:** Very Thirsty / Parched  
- **Symptoms:** Dry mouth + headache  

### Platform Output (Hydration Tab)
**Hydration Risk Score: VERY HIGH**

The platform detects:
- dehydration risk driven by low water + excessive caffeine
- strong association with headache and fatigue risk

**Immediate actions:**
- drink 2 cups water in the next 2 hours
- reduce caffeine after 2 PM
- keep a bottle on the desk as a behavioral trigger

## Day 3 — Eye Strain & Screen Overload

Ahmed records:

- **Screen session length:** 4+ hours  
- **Eye strain level:** 8/10  
- **Symptoms:** Blurred vision + headache behind eyes  
- **Lighting:** Mixed  
- **Brightness:** Brighter than room  
- **20-20-20 rule:** Never  

### Platform Output (Eye Tab)
**Eye Strain Risk Score: HIGH**

The platform notes:
- excessive screen exposure without recovery breaks
- likely digital eye strain pattern

**Suggested interventions:**
- apply the 20-20-20 rule (with reminders)
- reduce screen brightness to match room lighting
- blink reminders + hydration improvement to reduce dryness

## Day 4 — Musculoskeletal Pain Escalation

Ahmed records:

- **Pain level:** 7/10  
- **Focus area:** Neck + shoulders/upper back  
- **Pain nature:** Stiffness/tightness  
- **Onset timing:** End of workday  
- **Morning stiffness:** Yes  
- **Triggers:** Stress + long typing sessions  
- **Impact on work:** Yes  
- **Impact on sleep:** Mild  

### Platform Output (MSK Tab)
**MSK Risk Score: VERY HIGH**

The platform detects:
- repetitive strain + tension pain pattern
- progressive risk for chronic neck/upper back dysfunction

**Recommended actions:**
- 5-minute neck and shoulder stretching routine twice daily
- reduce laptop-only posture by adding external keyboard/mouse if possible
- short posture reset every hour

## Day 5 — Burnout Risk Signals Appear

Ahmed records his mental status:

- **Stress level:** 9/10  
- **Mood:** Irritable  
- **Focus:** Poor / fragmented  
- **Energy:** Low  
- **Sleep quality:** Poor  
- **Work-life detachment:** Unable to switch off  
- **Feeling overwhelmed:** Yes  

### Platform Output (Mental Tab)
**Burnout Risk Score: CRITICAL**

The platform identifies:
- strong burnout pattern
- impaired recovery cycle
- reduced cognitive resilience

**Warning:**
This pattern increases the risk of:
- decision fatigue
- errors in coordination
- reduced leadership performance
- chronic sleep disruption

# 🧠 Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition (The Key Value)

After 5 days, the platform generates a context-aware summary:

### Detected Pattern
Ahmed’s symptoms are not isolated.

The platform links:
- **low hydration + high caffeine** → fatigue + headaches  
- **long screen sessions + no breaks** → eye strain + blurred vision  
- **poor posture + laptop-only setup** → neck/shoulder pain  
- **high stress + poor recovery** → burnout escalation and reduced productivity  

This creates a reinforcing cycle:

**stress → poor sleep → fatigue → caffeine overuse → dehydration → headache → reduced focus → more stress**

# 📊 End-of-Week Risk Dashboard Summary

## Workday Health Index (WHI)
**89 / 100 — CRITICAL RISK**

### Highest Domain Scores
- Burnout / Stress: Critical
- MSK Risk: Very High
- Workspace Ergonomic Risk: High
- Eye Strain Risk: High
- Hydration Risk: Very High

### Top Drivers (Explainable)
1. Stress 9/10 with poor recovery and no detachment from work  
2. Severe dehydration pattern (low water + high caffeine + headache)  
3. Prolonged sitting and laptop-only posture with poor ergonomics  
4. Extended screen exposure without protective breaks

- Replace 1 coffee with water or oral rehydration drink
- 3-minute break every 60 minutes
- Reduce screen brightness and enable night mode
- Switch some meetings to voice-only to reduce screen load

## 7-Day Prevention Plan (Realistic for Field Work)
- Daily hydration target: **8–10 cups**
- Add **20-20-20 reminders**
- Add **micro-stretching reminders** every 45–60 minutes
- Set a **hard stop** for work messages after 10 PM
- Introduce a 10-minute recovery walk daily (even inside the compound)

## Safety Guardrail Warning
The platform recommends urgent evaluation if:
- headaches worsen or vision changes occur
